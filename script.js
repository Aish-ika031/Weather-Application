// The getElementById() method of the Document interface returns an Element object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string. Since element IDs are required to be unique if specified, they're a useful way to get access to a specific element quickly.

// Implementation of Search Button

//The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element.

//The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting existing event handlers.

//So here on searchButton variable which we have accessed above in the code over this variable we are applying a eventListner to search for locatrion which user specifes.

    //?q=${location} : this line means as we have to search for the current location which user has passed its weather so we are attaching this location string query in the URl.

    //&appid=${apiKey} adds another query string parameter appid (likely representing the API key used to authenticate the request) because every API has a key whch we genertae when we signup on the website to use the API.It is imp step in every API usage.

    //&units=metric : This line means as we have to search for temp so metric here menas in Celsius.
